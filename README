Hey! 
This is my first android app that I made on Android Studio! 

So What Does it Do?
This App serves as a simple random number generator, that generates a number based on the range given by the user. 
The user can manipulate that range using the red Circle towards the bottom. 
Press Roll Dice, and get a random number!

This project required creating a layout, and then linking everything together using Kotlin.

Enjoy!
